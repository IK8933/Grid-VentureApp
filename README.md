# 🌍 Grid-Venture
GridVenture is a visually structured, interactive, scalable, retro-inspired, grid-based exploration puzzle game built with React and Tailwind CSS. Players traverse a mysterious world of paths, forests, and caves, solving puzzles and collecting tools to overcome obstacles and progress through the map. With interactive NPCs, dynamic HUD-based dialog, and limited visibility mechanics, Grid-Venture delivers an immersive gameplay experience full of discovery and problem-solving.
